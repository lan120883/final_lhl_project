### Problem Statement
In this study I am going to predict food price in Saskatoon by doing research somes groceries stores in Saskatoon. The data was collected from 2020. During this time covid 19 was still going on.The aim is to build a predictive model for food price in Saskatoon, SK in particular and see if covid 19 impacted on food price or not.
